# Ecology Center Workshops: Python 101
Repository with Google Colab notebooks for a basic introduction to Python.

# Welcome!
The notebooks in this repository use Google Colabratory notebooks (like Jupyter Notebooks) that run Python natively in your browser, no installation necessary. The outline for this workshop is as follows:
1) Python IDEs: Installation, Environments, & Packages
  * How do you use Python on your machine
  * How can you install new packages
  * Some options and alternatives
2) Pyton 101: Strings, Lists, Tuples, Arrays
  * Basic datatypes & operations in Python
  * "Base-R" equivalent in Python
3) Data Wrangling & Carpentry: Pandas 
  * [R vs. Python - A One-on-One Comparison](https://shiring.github.io/r_vs_python/2017/01/22/R_vs_Py_post)
  * [Creating, Reading & Writing (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/residentmario/creating-reading-and-writing)
  * [Indexing, Selecting & Assigning (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/residentmario/indexing-selecting-assigning)
  * [Summary Functions & Maps (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/residentmario/summary-functions-and-maps)
  * [Grouping & Sorting (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/residentmario/grouping-and-sorting)
  * [Data Types & Missing Values (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/residentmario/data-types-and-missing-values)
  * [Renaming and Combining (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/residentmario/renaming-and-combining)
4) Some Statistical Packages in Python:

| Category   | Package          | Description                                                                                      | Notes                               |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Figures    | Matplotlib       | Base environment for figure, animations, and image plotting in python                            |                                     |
|            | Seaborn          | Scientific Figures (see [https://python-graph-gallery.com/](https://python-graph-gallery.com/)   |                                     |
|            | Plotly           | Interactive figures and visualizations, web-based                                                | Documentation is somewhat cryptic   |
| Statistics | Scikit-Learn     | Machine learning (i.e., classification,regression, clustering, model selection) tools in Python. | Very fast, excellent documentation  |
|            | Sci-Py           | Vast package of math, statistics, probability distributions, etc.                                |                                     |
|            | Statsmodels      | Like its companion in R - friendly and easy to use, formula syntax modelling                     |                                     |
|            | TensorFlow       | Google machine-learning package, has just about everything                                       | Documentation is rough              |
|            | Dask,Xarray      | Great packages that allow you to use data that is bigger than your machine (local cacheing)      | Excellent tools, good to know about |
|            | XgBoost,CatBoost | Fast & accurate gradient descent boosted regression tree packages                                |                                     |
